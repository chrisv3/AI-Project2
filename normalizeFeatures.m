function features = normalizeFeatures(features)
% NORMALIZEFEATURES normalizes the features.
%   FEATURES = NORMALIZEDFEATURES(FEATURES) computes the normalized version
%   of the features using various norms. For example if the l2 norm of the
%   features are used, each column is of unit length.

% Implement this!
